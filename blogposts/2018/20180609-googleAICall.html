    <h2>Google AI Call</h2>
    <h5>2018.06.09</h5>

        <br><br>
        Hey, so although this post is really late, I don’t really care. I saw this a while back and I thought it was
        awesome, but got side tracked with work and never wrote about it. So here I am late to the game. But in the
        event that you might not know what I’m referencing about, just keep reading. Haha.<br><br>

        <strong>The Phone Call</strong><br>
        Last month Google released a demo of an AI attempting to make a hair appointment over the phone, with a real
        person. In the phone call the AI suggests a time, the person suggests another time, and then the AI finally
        accepts a time, person asks for a name, AI provides a name, both say goodbye and hang up. And honestly it
        does sound like a real person on the phone, which is both exciting and creepy, yet funny to me. Its exciting
        because you realize that AI has greatly advanced so far that it can now mimic humans and that’s no longer
        Scifi! Thats insane! But then its creepy because the woman on the phone has no idea shes talking to a robot,
        and so now you feel bad..and weird. But the concept is funny because phone calls are pointless and what is
        Google trying to accomplish here? Who even makes phone calls  anymore? Everything is done online. You want
        groceries or household supplies, you can have them delivered. We live in that kind of world now, phones
        aren’t phones, they’re everything else. So google, I love you and all, but what are you getting at? lol.<br><br>

        <strong>Machine Learning</strong><br>
        In the <b><i><a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html?m=1">google article</a></i></b>
        they mentioned they used Recurring Neural Networks (RNN), which is an algorithm that
        finds the optimal ordering of specific words depending on a response just received. This interesting to me
        because 1) I actually knew what they were talking about because I just learned it this past spring in my
        machine learning class, but 2) because they also used <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow</a>,
        and tensorflow is an open source tool for implementing machine learning algorithms. And that is also a tool
        we used in class. So I definitely suggest you play around that if AI/machine learning peaks your interest.
        Go and Google all the things.<br><br>

        If not, dont worry, I very much intended to write on how to get started with
        <b><i><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow</a></i></b> and <b><i><a href="https://keras.io/">keras</a></i></b>
        and all the machine learning knowledge I can share. So stay tuned for that in a future blog post.<br><br>

        In conclusion, machine learning for the win for finding a solution to reduce even more human interaction in
        the real world and allowing us to progress our isolation in society. Too dark or too honest?
