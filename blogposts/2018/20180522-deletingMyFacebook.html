    <h2>Deleting My Facebook Account</h2>
    <h5>2018.05.22</h5>

        <br><br>
        So I finally deleted my Facebook account! Yay! :]<br><br>

        I had been putting it off for a while now and I don’t know why? To be honest I never logged in. Didn’t
        even have the app on my phone. That’s how little I used it. Although it might’ve been because I was
        dreading finding out what data Facebook had on me. But today I found out! This is due to the whole
        Cambridge Analytica (<b><i><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/02/cambridge_analytica_shutdown/">now
        Emerdata</a></i></b>) and Facebook debacle.<br><br>

        <strong>Fuel To My Fire</strong><br>
        I  have to admit though, after I logged in, I started scrolling. Scrolling through recent pictures my
        sisters posted. Scrolling through cat videos an old friend I NEVER talk to any more posted. Scrolling and
        finding out someone I never talk to recently went to the movies 55mins ago. Scrolling for no apparent
        reason other than it was just automatic. It took me a whole 10-20 mins to realize I had been zombified and
        was mindlessly scrolling like an idiot. I was embarrassed. Don’t judge me though! I was finally aware of my
        actions after. This just further fueled my need to delete my account!<br><br>

        <strong>Download Your Data First</strong><br>
        Before I delete though, I made sure to downloaded all the data Facebook had on me, and …it was creepy to say
        the least, and thats coming from me. The obvious were that they had pictures and recorded all your likes to
        posts. But it also saves your search history, your contacts, their numbers, a folder for every person
        you’ve ever messaged via Facebook messenger. It also saved every post anyone has ever posted on your
        timeline. And that’s just for a minimal user. I stopped using Facebook heavily back several years ago.
        I cant even begin to fathom what it might have on someone other heavy users of Facebook. Who integrate all
        other third party apps and credit card transactions. Creeps me out.<br><br>

        But yes, I highly recommend everyone at least download a copy of their data on Facebook, even if you arent
        bold enough to delete it just yet. Its always good to know.<br><br>

        A good podcast that goes briefly into this, and has some useful links is
        <a href="https://www.smashingsecurity.com/75"><b><i>Smashing Security</i></b></a>. This is a pretty
        light hearted podcast concerning security. Give it a try and see if you like it. :]<br><br>

        Anyways, that’s all for now. Let me know if you’ve also deleted it or not? Or let me know why you havent.
        I’d really like to know.
