    <h2>How to use Virtual Box ‚Äì A Short Guide</h2>
    <h5>2018.09.23</h5>

        <br><br>
        This week I wanted to talk about virtual machines and hypervisors. To elaborate, a virtual machines a
            ‚Äúmachine‚Äù that is sharing physical hardware with another machine but is logically seen as another machine
            by said physical machine. They share storage, memory, processor etc, except they see each other as
            separate machines. It took me a while to wrap my head around it, but at some point I figured it out
            through trial and error. So many (vm) casualties!! ha. Dont get attached to your vms though. But dont
            fret, once you figure out how it works, you‚Äôll find it immensely useful for firing up a kali box, or
            practice on some pen testing skills or anything.

        Anyways, there are a couple of applications to achieve this, but I am only going to talk about virtual box
        since its open source, and open source is always Queeeeen!
        [add image here]<br><br>

        <strong>1. Download</strong>
        First things first, you need to go and download Virtual Box and can do so at: https://www.virtualbox.org/
            Download according to your machine. Pretty simple so far.
        <br>
        Then you need to download an ISO. This is the all data contained for a virtual machine in one easily
            downloadable image. Think of this like a prepackaged laptop. The OS is in there, applications are in
            there. All the things. So you can imagine its a prety big file. These files are called ISO files, because
            (according to wiki) it originated from ISO 9660.
            Anyways! You can choose to download some of the following linux based machines (they‚Äôre all open source
            too):<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Fedora: https://alt.fedoraproject.org/</li>
            <li>Kali: https://www.kali.org/downloads/</li>
            <li>CentOS: https://www.centos.org/download/</li>
            <li>Ubuntu: https://www.ubuntu.com/download</li>
        </ul><br>

        Random Cee fact:
        Fedora was my introduction into a linux environment. My boss thought it was time for me to learn it since I
        had been on the team for a while and thought I should understand the environment. So he arbitrarily chose
        Fedora. Maybe as a lark? Nevertheless, Fedora will always have a special place in my heart. üôÇ <br><br>

        <strong>2. Stahhhhp! Think about your available resources now</strong><br>
        You need to take into account that this machine will be sharing resources with your actual physical machine,
        so you‚Äôll need to make sure you have ENOUGH resources to sustain this (i.e. storage, memory etc). If you
        don‚Äôt have enough you will run into trouble. For now since this may be your first time doing this, make
        sure you have at least double the amount. (if it‚Äôs not your first time then why are you here? Are you not
        entertained? üôÇ )<br><br>

        <strong>3. Create a New Virtual Machine</strong><br>
        Give it a name, and choose its OS. They‚Äôre all Linux but their version will be dependent on what kind of
        machine you current own (e.g. 32 bit or 64 bit).
        [add image here]<br><br>

        <strong>4. Give it some Memory</strong><br>
        You should be fine with giving it 1024 MB.

        <strong>5. Create a Virtual Hard Disk </strong><br>
        Since this is your first time create a virtual machine, you‚Äôll be selecting
        Create a virtual hard disk now.
        [add image here]<br><br>

        <strong>6. Select a Hard disk File Type</strong><br>
        Since we already downloaded an ISO image, we‚Äôll select the VDI option.

        <strong>7. Storage on Physical Hard Disk</strong><br>
        Choose how the physical machine will allocate storage for the virtual machine.
        Select Dynamically allocated<br><br>

        <strong>8. File Location and Size </strong><br>
        Decide on where the machine will be stored and how big the storage will be. The default for where it‚Äôs
        filed (i.e. the directory) is fine, no need to move it, and for the storage I‚Äôd give it a bit more than the
        recommended, just in case‚Ä¶

        <strong>9. Start and Install the ISO</strong><br>
        Click the Start arrow and then select the folder icon and locate where the downloaded ISO image is at.
        [add image here]<br><br>

        <strong>10. Final Items</strong><br>
        Once your past all that, you should be able to move on through. Then you will need to give root a password
        and make sure its not weak. It‚Äôll take a bit to install the ISO, around 5 -10 mins and you may need to
        reboot. This depends on which ISO you chose. Once its all download youre all set!<br>

        So I chose not to show a Kali vm specifically in this post because I thought that deserved a separate post
        all together. VM and Kali are two different things and deserve there separate respected post. My next post
        may be on a Kali VM and exploring it further.<br>

        But for now, here is what you will see if you chose to create a Fedora VM.<br><br>

        <i>Errors you might encounter below.</i><br>
        First: If you are asked to reinstall the ISO, it may be that you need to delete the ISO from the optical
        disk, which you can do so by selecting the Storage tab, and right click the Fedora ISO and select Remove
        Attachment. This will make it appear to the machine as the machine will start normally.

        Second: If your vm is crazy slow, it may be that your Memory default settings need to be changed. You can do
        this by selecting the System tab, and change the 1024MB youve allocated to a bit more. This will vary.
        Remember back to Step 2 and tweak accordingly (or through trial and error). Maybe close all the things your
        currently running on your machine, and see how it goes. Sorry if this isnt exact, but its not, cause I
        don‚Äôt know the current processor youre using, but you do (or will after this).

        After you get it going your set. You now have a basic understanding of how Virtual box works. YAY go you! üòÄ<br>
        Thats all for now. Hope this was helpful and I‚Äôll see you in the next post! Take Care! üôÇ
