    <h2>Adabox 007</h2>
    <h5>2018.04.28</h5>

        <br><br>
        Lets talk about the Adabox subscription box today!<br>

        If you don‚Äôt know what an Adabox is, then continue reading! Ha. It‚Äôs a mail box subscription from Adafruit
        and it contains several IoT ‚Äúthings‚Äù in it, and you can assemble a fun tech gadget or maybe robot with
        these items.<br><br>

        They‚Äôre meant for you to explore the world of microcontrollers and you can learn how to build something
        and understand how the different moving parts interact with one another. It does require some patience and
        some research in order for you to finally figure out what you wanna build. But this box is a GREAT first
        step in entering this world.<br><br>

        I only found out about it a month or two ago because I was going to purchase an arduino or other to play
        around with and see what I would create? Well the Adafruit banner caught my interest and I got curious‚Ä¶.and
        here we are! Haha.<br><br>

        Now I don‚Äôt easily fall for ads cause they usually don‚Äôt apply to me, but I a was already going to purchase
        something from Adafruit, so I figured, why not?<br><br>

        <strong>Expectations</strong><br>
        I didn‚Äôt have any insane expectation. I just figured it was like any subscription box, but instead of good
        or beauty products it‚Äôs resistors and led lights. Haha. I did have to wait a couple of months, but that
        wasn‚Äôt a big deal cause I had no real plans as to what I would get or do with it?<br><br>

        <strong>The Adabox</strong><br>
        When the box finally arrived, it was excited and it felt like Christmas! üòÄ And I gotta say, I subscribed at
        the perfect time because this box was awesomely tailored for me cause it had several ‚Äùhacker‚Äù related things.<br><br>

        A few items to mention that were in the 007 (Double Oh Seven) Adabox were:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Gemma M0</li>
            <li>Lockpick set</li>
            <li>Piezzo buzzer</li>
            <li>Clear padlock</li>
            <li>Radio Antenna</li>
            <li>IR receiver senor</li>
            <li>Hackerspace Magazine</li>
        </ul><br>

        If you‚Äôre curious as to what all was in the box, Adabox released an unboxing of it on
        <b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVLfoYQd9PQ">Youtube</a></i></b> , so go check that out! Be part of their community! Ha. I only
        took some picture which I uploaded to Instagram, so you‚Äôre welcome to check that out and follow me if you
        aren‚Äôt already! üôÇ<br><br>

        Obviously the star was the Adafruit Gemma M0 which you can connect to the buzzer or antenna or other
        existing IoT things you already have and either use it to prank someone or find a useful purspise for it.
        I‚Äôm hoping to find a full functioning use for it. I first need to find a problem I need to fix with it
        though? Ill have to see what I think up of. Stay tuned to find out. Ha.<br><br>

        <strong>What are your thoughts?</strong><br>
        But anyways, those are my thoughts on the Adabox. I think its pretty neat, and will continue on with my
        subscription. I like the community Adafruit has to offer. But what do you think though? Do you think you‚Äôll
        get a subscription box, or nah, you think its mainly for n00bs and prefer to just buy your own items as
        needed? Let me know in the comments!
