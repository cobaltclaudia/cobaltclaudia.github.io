    <h2>Oh Hello </h2>
    <h5>Feb 10, 2021.02.10</h5>

    <p><b><i>This is a test blog post page. Only added lyrics cause i love Circa Survive, duh. This site is
        still a
        testing site.</i></b></p>
    <p>Didn't I know you, mystery man?</p>
    <p>Strange as all new thoughts on impotence.</p>

    <p>All I want are windows</p>
    <p>It wouldn't be the first time.</p>

    <p>Didn't I, didn't I know you?</p>
    <p>Didn't I, didn't I know you, didn't I know you?</p>
    <p>All along, all we've been given is the ugliest tidings.</p>
    <p>All along, we've been a mess.</p>
    <p>Now quick dilation is the only chance we have left.</p>

    <p>A stranger's just someone that you've forgotten.</p>
    <p>How will we know if we've met before or done this dance,</p>
    <p>Mystery man?</p>

    <p>Didn't I, didn't I know you?</p>
    <p>Didn't I, didn't I know you, didn't I know you?</p>
    <p>All along, all we've been given is the ugliest tidings.</p>
    <p>All along, we've been a mess.</p>
    <p>Now quick dilation is the only chance we have left.</p><br><br><br>
