    <h2>May 2021</h2>
    <h5>2021.05.13</h5>

        <br><br>
        Hey internet void. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve written anything, but someone on twitter today asked how many
        domains do I have and I remembered this site still exists and pictured a tumble weed in my head when I
        answered. So here I am.<br><br>

        Anyways, I read my last post, and yeah‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve been in a depressive slump. Nothing clinical, mostly just
        sadness as I know why I‚Äôm down. Its the same reason everyone in the world is down right now. Quarantine as
        well as a break up got me really down, and nothing left to do except go through the emotions and wait for
        time to tell for the world to get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure others are worse off, but that doesn‚Äôt minimize my
        sadness.<br><br>

        Now, it seems as though things are getting slightly better. I fortunately have received both my vaccines and
        see a light at the end of the tunnel, but sadly I know that‚Äôs not the case for everyone.<br><br>

        And while yes I‚Äôm still heart broken, I‚Äôm functioning enough to not tear up when I remember memories or
        listen to songs that remind me of him. Still sucks, but thats heartache, just have to make sure to not
        suppress the sadness and ride out the storm to see the rainbow. Suppressing and avoiding your emotions just
        prolongs the suffering.<br><br>

        But yeah, because of ALL THAT, I haven‚Äôt made much progress towards all the things I wrote back in‚Ä¶.*looks at
        date on last post* ‚Ä¶August! FuCK its been a year! Sadge. Yeah mostly been mentally keeping it together
        during isolation. :/ <br><br>

        Anyways, I‚Äôm gonna forget about progress, and just start fresh. Tabula rasa. Clean slate.<br><br>

        What am I excited for right now? Whether it be books, learning, classes, people etc.<br><br>

        <strong>What am I currently reading? </strong><br>
        tech/career:<br>
        ‚Äì Build your dream network<br>
        ‚Äì Smart Girls Guide to Privacy<br>
        ‚Äì Artificial Unintelligence<br><br>

        fiction/non-fiction:<br>
        ‚Äì HP5<br>
        ‚Äì Field guide to getting lost<br>
        ‚Äì war of art<br>
        ‚Äì WoT 3<br><br>

        <strong>What am I currently learning? </strong><br>
        Still learning as part of my job, which is obviously still cool and why I love my job, and has honestly been
        keeping me sane during this crazy time. But yeah, some environments I got to play around with were Okta and
        Microsoft Azure, then I deepened my knowledge on LDAP, and then got to play around with Greynoise. All of
        these are integrations for Graylog for which I took part in building the past year. üôÇ Check us out if you so
        desire, were open source.<br><br>

        On the side though, I am still interested in ML, it just stopped cause I was in a slump, but currently making
        my way through this ML course playlist on YT. And at the moment I‚Äôm on lesson 2.4, so slowly but surely ill
        get there, provided I don‚Äôt hit another slump, but yeah mostly mood driven.<br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN">
            https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN</a><br><br>

        <strong>What am I sharing?</strong><br>
        I‚Äôm not sure on this one. Took a long break from Instagram, and felt ashamed to say anything on twitter, since
        thats where I have the most followers. Isolation will do that I suppose? There just wasn‚Äôt much to say or
        share other then life suck, heartache sucks, and asking myself existential questions, and that doesnt add
        anything to any conversation.<br><br>

        I have been sporadically posting on my
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgN1TkNGDC5ki1WSkIpISFA/videos"> youtube channel</a>, but with no real
        direction to be honest. I‚Äôve treated it the way I treat reading books, its entirely based on my mood.
        Mainly just sharing what I read. I do hate being on camera, but it kinda helps with my public speaking, but
        talking about books is easy and I like that. On a side note however, I have been enjoying
        <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cobaltclaudia">‚Äúvlogging‚Äù on TikTok</a>. Not really vlogging, mostly just
        stringing together live photos that i would take throughout the week. Sometimes theres beauty in the mundane,
        and mundane is all there is now. Was surprised at how much I enjoyed that. I dont know why, but it made me feel
        better somehow. It allowed me to still express myself I think? idk, im not a psychologist. /shrug But I enjoy
        it, so will probably keep doing it.<br><br>

        Yeah, it‚Äôs a Jackson Pollock here, kinda of all over the place.<br><br>

        I‚Äôm still intrigued by streaming, as I have NOW honestly seen the value and effect it can have on people. I
        live alone and work from home, but having a stream on in the background while I work has made me feel less
        alone. And im sure that sounds sad and bonkers to norm andys, but who cares. All that to say, it be nice to
        have that effect on people. But it obviously comes with its own risk, hence the hesitation even before this
        shit show year. But it would be nice to make a community.<br><br>

        <strong>What am I even saying?</strong><br>
        All this so say that I‚Äôm forgiving myself for the lack of progress I‚Äôve made since August 2020. I could only
        run on empty for so long, eventually the buck stops. I was hopeful and naive, and had no clue of what was to
        come. And my mental and physical health were top priority at the time, and thats ok.<br><br>

        Pointless post to be honest, mostly just writing for future me to read and look back on. A breakpoint for
        debugging in the future.<br><br>

        If someone is actually reading this, I hope you‚Äôre alright and hope your mental and physical health are well.<br><br>

        Take care. Prayge.
