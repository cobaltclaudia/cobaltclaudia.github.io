    <h2>November 2021</h2>
    <h5>2021.11.30</h5>

        <br><br>
        Hello. I’m a bit freaked out. Made a huge grown up decision and am still kind of in shock, but not regretting
        it. Change is inevitable and is required for progress. Taking the first leap is just always scary.<br><br>

        I’m purposely speaking vague, but future me will know what I’m getting at.<br><br>

        Anyways, why did I start writing this post?… oh right, progress, intentions, learning, life update, etc.<br><br>

        Lets rewind. This past October I had the opportunity to not only go to some conferences, but I also got to go
        to a live show in California. The conferences were LASCON (Lonestar Application Security CONference) and
        Texas Cyber Summit, and the show was Chainfest.<br><br>

        And I had an amazing time! I got to experience a live show again after almost two years. Something I had been
        dying to do forever but couldnt cause the world is in the shitter. Circa Survive and Taking Back Sunday and
        Jimmy Eat World were all there. This was the first time (and probably only time) seeing both Taking Back Sunday
        and Jimmy Eat World. Anyways, I was reminded of what it was like to be happy and in the moment. And I loved
        every minute of it and was deeply sad when I returned home. Nothing last forever.<br><br>

        The next weekend was the conferences, and while I am not the greatest at networking, I did still have a lot of
        fun. Listening to the enthusiasm in some of these speakers talks was quite a thing to experience. A couple of
        talks peaked my interest in learning a new coding language and what I could do with that, and other talk gave
        useful advise on dabbling into different skills. That same week I started a coding tutorial and remember I went
        to sleep very late that night because I had lost track of time. I was having fun coding again. Not coding
        cause I have to but coding because I want to. No longer feeling like an imposter. I AM a coder, and I
        felt like myself again. Felt good.<br><br>

        Anyways, after those two weekends, something shifted. Some sparks had occured. And I didn’t realize something
        was missing until I felt that.<br><br>

        So in tending to keep that spark, or recapture it, I have some intentions I want to write down.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>    One spark that occured was being excited for a new coding language. I dont know why I would learn
                it, but thats not the point. The point is to have fun again. So I will get back to continuing in
                learning that.</li><br>

            <li>    Another spark occured was because I was listening to Circa Survive. I wanna make a circa tweet bot.
                And while I’m sure this may already exist, I still just want to create it cause it sounds fun. </li><br>

            <li>    Last one makes me a bit embarrassed but also its a reoccuring spark. Idk why im interested in it,
                but it hasnt gone away, and thats <a href="https://twitch.tv.cobaltclaudia/">to try streaming</a> and
                    making more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgN1TkNGDC5ki1WSkIpISFA">vlogging Youtube
                        videos</a> again. theres something creative about it that the inner artist in me wants to actually fully explore. So im going to do just that. </li>
        </ul><br>

        Tech is always changing, and thats the fun in it. And you gotta put your own meaning in life, otherwise its
        just not worth existing.<br><br>

        Thanks care<br><br>

        Byeeeeee
