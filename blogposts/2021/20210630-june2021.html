    <h2>June 2021</h2>
    <h5>2021.06.30</h5>

        <br><br>
        Hey hey, update time. June is over and I am feeling unaccomplished. Sadge.<br><br>

        Anyways, in regards to my mental state, I‚Äôm okay I guess, no longer sad but rather existential and a mix of
        optimistic nihilism. It ebbs and flows to be honest. I still feel off. Was limiting my time on twitter and
        instagram and trying to read books that might help, none of which I share on this post. That kinda weird is on
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/cobaltclaudia">goodreads</a> though.<br><br>

        But enough of that, no sense in pitying myself. Does no good. Future me will figure it out.<br><br>

        <strong>What am I excited about? </strong><br>
        I streamed for the first time on my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cobaltclaudia">twitch channel</a>>! My friend
        supported me in the chat! üòÄ That was scary though, but got over the speed bump of taking the first step. Now
        just have to figure out what I intend to use that given that i have no followers at the moment. FeelsStrongMan.
        Maybe use it to catch up on security related news stuff, or my accountability study partner? not sure. twitch
        is best when theres an interaction, but its pretty impossible for that if im talking to the internet void
        (much like right now or yt) and my friend wont always be in the chat. Hmm.<br><br>

        Additionally I‚Äôm trying to CREATE more. Anything, for now it‚Äôs just creating more videos on my
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgN1TkNGDC5ki1WSkIpISFA">yt channel</a>. I hit a wall at first, but
        now trying to stay consistent and just sharing whatever the fuck i feel like. I removed the pressure of finding
        a niche and just saying FUCK IT! Basic tech videos or vlogs, or geeky book videos and shit, whatever fuels my
        artistic expression. we‚Äôre all gonna die someday, so FUCK IT! Optimistic nihilism. Maybe ill also apply that
        mentality to my twitch channel too.<br><br>

        <strong>What books did I read? </strong><br>
        With books I‚Äôm kinda all over the place. no niche. But this pass month I read:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Building your dream network by J. Kelly Hoey</li>
            <li>The War of Art by Steven Pressfield </li>
        </ul><br>

        Pretty good books. Building your dream network was kinda helpful. I dont think i read it at the appropriate
        time though given that I‚Äôm on a social media diet. But I picked it up because Cassidoo on twitter recommended
        it during her live stream, and i thought it would be a good way to meet more tech people. All the peeps on
        infosec twitter seem to be friends and i get serious fomo sometimes, like ‚Äúhey, id like a friendship‚Äù But yeah
        idk, there were a lot of interview questions in the book that were pretty specific and I didnt care too much
        for that format. But decent book.<br><br>

        The War of Art was good. Good to pick up if you need a bit of inspiration and help in combating resistance. But
        yeah, its written like several post its with inspiration thoughts were strung together to make a book. Some
        really great nuggets though about resistance and inspiring you to just punch resistance in the face. Fuck that
        asshole. But towards the end it gets a bit woo woo, and I‚Äôm not opposed to woo woo, but it felt kinda out of
        place.<br><br>

        Cant decide if they stay or go from my physical book shelf, but either way theyll live in my virtual bookshelf
        on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/claudiaandbooks/">instagram</a>.<br><br>

        <strong>What goal am I after?</strong><br>
        Fuck what a question. why am i asking this? this is uncomf. Yeah not sure. All i know is I like creating shit,
        both technical and creative, and I like learning all there is that sparks my interests. Peeps in infosec seem
        to be 1000% sure they know what they want to do, and it results to getting some overly priced cert that end up
        expiring in the end. I admire that determination, but I‚Äôm not even sure what ill be doing next year. I do like
        data. that shit is interesting. Part of the reason I got into logging, so much meaningful data if you know how
        to look. I remember creating networking dashboards that got insanely detailed at my old job. My ex
        (yes that ex) even thought it was eerily accurate. Pretty funny to watch his reaction. He was a network admin
        and there i was providing a map to his domain. We complimented each other. He even helped me with my firewall.
        Sad it didnt work out. Fuck‚Ä¶ yeah wasnt meant to be.<br><br>

        Anyways‚Ä¶. maybe I should just try getting a cert? idk‚Ä¶ maybe i AM an imposter to the infosec community?
        monkaW i dont think i enjoy breaking shit as much as others do, building is much more fun and satisfying tbh.
        *gasp* hmm. need to research what certs actually sound fun, cause sec+ and oscp just dont sound fun, theyre
        useful, yeah, but not fun. And yeah, more money is always nice, and certs help in getting six figures‚Ä¶ which i
        currently do NOT make, but how do i get there while still having fun? Or do I even need to get there? the few
        people i do know that reached six figures sounded depressed last i heard from them. Does the capitalist
        mentality ever actually make anyone happy? Hmm. IDK. Happiness is usually found in doing, its never an
        end goal.<br><br>

        Yeah, big question, difficult to answer. /shrug<br><br>

        Leaving the gobbledygook paragraph for future me to debug.<br><br>

        <strong>What am I looking forward to?</strong><br>
        OH! I‚Äôm looking forwards to DEFCON 29! üòÄ very excited i got the green light to go as part of work, and a
        couple of days in Vegas, and traveling in general sounds fun, and HIGHLY needed. Ever since I booked all the
        things my mood has just been better. Still existential, but better. I registered for a web sec work shop and
        an assembly class, been a long time since i‚Äôve written assembly, not since college. Anyways, hopefully i meet
        up with some tech peeps and they dont think im too weird. i like being weird, but my people skills have gone
        to the shitter. :s<br><br>

        Oh! I did buy a bunch of books I‚Äôm excited to read, but idk when ill read them. Mood reader problems. I shared
        some of them on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cobaltclaudia__">instagram</a>. Ill only list the tech
        related books I bought. They‚Äôre listed in aesthetic order, obviously. Yes I love buying books, no its not a
        problem.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>The Big Nine by Webb</li>
            <li>Game Hacking by Cano</li>
            <li>Twitter and Tear gas by Tufekci</li>
            <li>Automating Inequality by Eubanks</li>
            <li>Real World Bug Hunting by Yaworski</li>
            <li>Python Machine Learning by Eddison</li>
            <li>Artificial Unintelligence by Broussard</li>
            <li>Weapons of Math destruction by O‚ÄôNeil</li>
            <li>The Pentester Blueprint by Wylie and Crawley</li>
            <li>Alice and Bob learn Application Security by Janca</li>
        </ul><br>

        I‚Äôm contemplating writing intentions. Given that I‚Äôm a little weird and off at the moment, it will probably
        work against me rather than for me, like I failed, and last year was enough failure for all of us.<br><br>
