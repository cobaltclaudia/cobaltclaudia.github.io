    <h2>Data Classification, Frameworks and Legal Agreements in Infosec</h2>
    <h5>2019.03.23</h5>
        <br>

    Hey! I'm aware that this post may not be for everyone. I write this in hopes that anyone reading this
        understands the difference between the different data classifications, and understands the severity of even
        losing one record, let alone thousands. I hope that if at least one person encounters it and learns, then I'll
        be happy.<br>

    Now I've structured this first by defining the classifications, then explaining the framework that help in
        structuring the proper controls are in place to safeguard this information, and then the legal agreements.

    Per usually, I'll TRY to keep this post brief and sweet. :) <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Data Classifications</h3><br>
    This is where people get lost. They tend to clump these all together, and while thats true that this inf<br>
        important, they're not treated equally. A good way to find out its classification is to ask the questions
        I've paired them with.<br><br>

    <b> PII </b><br>
     - Personally Identifiable InformationCan a stranger find out who I am with this info?<br>
     - Can they figure out my location with this info?<br>
    <br>

    <b> PCI </b><br>
     -- Payment Card IndustryCould a stranger make a purchase with this information?<br>
     - Would I be out of a debit/credit card if this information got in the wrong hands?<br><br>

    <b> PHI </b><br>
     - Personal Health InformationCan they identify my ethnicity or demographic?<br>
     - Can someone determine my illnesses or lab tests I recently had?<br>
     - Can they find out my insurance, or mental health state/condition?<br><br>

    <b> HIPAA </b><br>
     - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability ActIf an insurance company had this info, would <br>
        incentivize them to up-charge me on my insurance plan ?
     - If they know I had (diabetes/cancer/chronic illness/etc) would they classify me as a higher risk o<br>
        insurance plan and charge me more?
     - Now this generally entails PHI being handled, and is an Act that limits the types of PHI that health<br>
        providers and insurers collect from you, and who they share that information with for the very question I
        posed.<br><br>

    <b> FERPA </b><br>
    Family Educational Rights and Privacy ActCould a stranger pull records from my (school/college/university)
        and find out out the following:<br>
     - Student organization I am a part of<br>
     - Grades I received<br>
     - Know my class schedule and location<br>
     - This will also include PHI<br>
    This list may not be all inclusive, but you will gain a general understanding.<br><br><br>

    <h3>Frameworks</h3><br>
    Frameworks are a tool companies/organizations are expected to use to safeguard information and minimize cyber
        security risk. Risk can only be reduced, and never eliminated. Similar to the risk associated in driving a car,
        you can be a safe driver, but the risk of having a car accident is always present, so you need to pay attention
        and do your best in driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://www.nist.gov/"><b>NIST</b></a><br>
    National Institute of Standards and Technology<br>
    This framework is voluntary, and the organization safeguards its information by continuing to use use
        existing standards and guidelines already in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/"><b>PCI</b></a><br>
    DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard<br>
    This framework is for PCI and is mandated by card brands and is enforced by the Payment Card Industry
        Security Standards Council, which consists of companies such as American Express, Discover Financial Services,
        JCB International, MasterCard, and Visa.<br><br>


    <a href="https://www.iso.org/"><b>ISO 27001/27002</b></a><br>
    Information security management systems<br>
    This framework is the best-known standard in providing hard requirements for an information security
        management system. It helps small, medium and large businesses in any sector keep information assets secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/"><b>CIS</b></a><br>
    Critical Security Controls<br>
    Much like the previous one, except this one priorities which changes will have the most impactful as it will
        reference common attacks found in reports. Also a consensus between the infoSec community and government will
        drive these recommendation.<br><br><br>


    <h3>Legal Agreements</h3><br>
    <b>MOU/MOA</b><br>
    Memorandum of Understanding<br>
    formal but not legally binding agreement between two companies/orgs<br><br>

    <b>NDA</b><br>
    Non-disclosure agreement<br>
    legal contract between two companies/orgs that states that information must be restricted/not shared unless
        otherwise stated in the agreement<br><br>

    <b>SLA</b>
    Service Level Agreement<br>
    contract between a service provider and the company/org/person using the service and it states the leve<br>
        service thats expected from the service provider<br><br>

    <b>ISA</b><br>
    Interconnected Security Agreement<br><br>
    an agreement established between an org that own and operate IT systems and they are expected to document<br>
        connection at a very high level as well as from a very technical level<br><br>

    <b>BPA</b><br>
    Business Partner Agreement<br>
    pretty standard legal agreement between partners where they state their terms and conditions and expected
        relationship<br> <br>

    YAY you made it to the end! You go Glen Coco! Hope you learned something. Terminology can be tedious, but its
        very important, and even more so if you need to convey it others.<br><br>

    Anyways, until next time! Peace and happy securing! :) <br>
