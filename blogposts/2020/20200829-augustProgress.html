    <h2>August Progress</h2>
    <h5>2020.08.29</h5>

        <br><br>
        Heyyohh! August was quite productive and I’m proud of myself! I just noticed I haven’t written a blog post
        since July. Wonder if that’s a strat for accomplishing more?<br><br>

        Anyways, as usual, I’ll answer the follow questions to see where I’m progressing.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>What book(s) (in my field) did I read?</li>
            <li>What tech book (s)am I focused on, and how far am I?</li>
            <li>What have I learned this month?</li>
            <li>What knowledge have I shared with others?</li>
            <li>Did I participate in the tech community?</li>
            <li>How can I improve for next month?</li>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>What book did I read for August?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Countdown to Zero Day by Kim Zetter</li>
                -  4 stars on goodreads<br>
                -  From the 4/5 stars I gave it, you can tell i enjoyed it. Maybe I’ll explain this further why in a
                    quarterly book wrap up on my youtube channel<br>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>What tech books am I focused on and how far am I?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>I’m still currently reading Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz, which for the most part is interesting
                so I’ll continue it. I’m currently on chapter 5/11. But I am realizing that I’m just much more
                excited when I’m creating something.</li>
            <li>And because of that reason I’ve picked up another book, HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett. This book is
                helping me with my front end skills, which are currently garbage, but won’t be for long. I’ve been
                slowly modifying cobaltclaudia.github.io as needed to make it a bit more… pretty. And because of that
                I’m not really going in order with that book. The state of the site is indicative of how far I’m
                progressing.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>What have I learned this month?</strong><br>
        This month, aside from I’m learning whats in the books above, I’m also learning Machine Learning. I registered
        for a class on Coursera and been watching their videos and taking their quizzes. So far I’m only at the point
        of knowing what supervised & unsupervised learning is, as well as downloaded Octave for the math that’s
        needed. But not much else. But like the saying goes, slow and steady wins the race.<br><br>

        Side unnecessary learning: I’m also currently learning how to stream on twitch, and am seriously thinking of
        starting that in either September or October. It might be my accountability partner for learning Mon-Wed.
        Feel free to follow me there if you so desire? Might go well, might not, either way, I’ll at least trying.<br><br>

        <strong>What knowledge have I shared with others?</strong><br>
        So this month I actually managed to publish four videos on my Youtube channel, and of those 4, 3 were
        sharing knowledge.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/ZyhUK1gbvxY">Operation Security Domain Definitions for CISSP</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/4Jzjg5ffm28">Physical (Environmental) Security Domain Definitions for CISSP</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/_YTfMuTp3s0">How To Use Nmap</a></li>
        </ul><br>

        You’ll notice two are CISSP related, and (like i say in the videos) disclaimer I am not CISSP certified, I
        just happen to stumble across the flash cards while declutter, but wanted to share the definitions and not
        have them go to waste in the trash.<br><br>

        <strong>Did I participate in the tech community?</strong>
        This one is still a no, and its bumming me out. It’s not like I’m a pariah, its just a bit difficult for me
        to (virtually) socialize with others I don’t know very well. I’ve also been failing to attend the
        WeAreHackerz book clubs cause they kinda seem to happen at random times, and aren’t planned too far ahead
        in the week.<br><br>

        Defcon Safe mode also happened, but it wasn’t really social interactions, and more just watching talks on
        twitch. Which is cool for learning, but yeah, I’m at a stump with how to interact with the tech community.
        Might need to reevaluate why I set these intentions originally… cause it seems to be taking a back seat.<br><br>

        Although I think maybe streaming on Twitch might make me a bit more comfortable virtually socializing
        with internet peeps.<br><br>

        <strong>How can I improve for next month?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Books I think are progressing as expected, even the tech ones, so no complaints</li>
            <li>I’ll continue with ML on coursera, maybe make some videos as I continue learning, since teaching is
                the true test of knowing something</li>
            <li>I would like to share more of what I do know, so I might try and focus up on at least sharing on
                video a month like that. I’d like to be seen as a mentor, and not just some weirdo on twitter who
                shares animals videos cause they make me smile in this ever growing chaotic world D:</li>
            <li>My new venture will also be twitch. I might start streaming M-W for my learning after work, and maybe
                Friday if there’s a game I want to play. I’m hoping to start Sept, but wouldn’t be surprised if i
                push it to Oct.</li>
            <li>Definitely need to re-evalute my intention for how to take part in the tech community…</li>
        </ul><br>

        Damn I really wrote a bunch in this post, but it makes up for the two posts I didn’t write.<br><br>

        Anyways, thats it for now. I’ll talk to you all in the next one. Thanks for reading! Byeeee!<br><br>
