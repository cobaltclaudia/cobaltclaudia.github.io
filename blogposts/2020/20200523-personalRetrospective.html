    <h2>A Personal Retrospective</h2>
    <h5>2020.05.23</h5>

        <br><br>
        <p>Hey internet friends. Been a long ass while since I‚Äôve blogged anything. Last year was quite a busy ride and
            hardly have a moment to catch my breath, and that was honestly frickin‚Äô amazing. I miss that beautiful
            productive chaos!</p><br>

        <p>Now, however, were in this weird moment in time where all we can do it sit with our thoughts and
            contemplate our existence and meaning and that can be‚Ä¶overwhelming and exhausting.</p><br>

        <p>I don‚Äôt want to get philosophical here though, that‚Äôs not why THIS blog exists.</p><br>

        <p>But I thought I‚Äôd take a moment to pause and reevaluate my personal side projects that I‚Äôve kind of left to
            the waste side and I need to figure out why that is? The whole reason for why I even started this blog.
            Hence, the title.</p><br>

        <p>A sort of personal retrospective mission statement for future me to once again look back on and reflect and
            answer questions like:</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Why did I start this blog?</li>
            <li>Why don‚Äôt I feel the need to blog as often?</li>
            <li>How are my side projects going? (see <a href="#">Back From Hiatus</a>)</li>
            <li>What‚Äôs new?</li>
            <li>Am I still learning new things?</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h2>Why did I start this blog?</h2>
        <p>I started it as a digital journal for keeping track of my technical abilities and intentions. Something I
            can keep track of. It also jots down my mental head space professionally.</p><br>

        <p>However this isn‚Äôt working out as effectively as I‚Äôd hoped. It works as looking back, but not so much as
            making progress. The time gaps between each post don‚Äôt properly show where I‚Äôm at mentally and
            technically.</p><br>

        <h2>Why dont I feel the need to blog as often?</h2>

        <p>A lot of the times imposter syndrome sets in and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm qualified enough to speak authoritatively
            on a topic, OR I think a post I‚Äôm about to write has been overly done. A combination of the two sets in,
            and I lose the initial enthusiasm for writing the post.</p><br>

        <h2>How are my side project(s) going (see <a href="#">Back From Hiatus</a>)?</h2><br>
        <p>1. Conferences</p>
        <p>- Last year I succeeded in attending several conferences. It was a lot of fun! 100 points to Slytherin! üòÄ</p>
        <p>- BUT for obvious reasons (covid-19 pandemic) attending conferences physically are not in the horizon
            anymore. But virtual conferences are still happening, and I can attend those virtually.</p><br>

        <p>2. Books</p>
        <p>- Here is where I didn‚Äôt do so hot. I found that I‚Äôm a more of a mood reader and can‚Äôt force myself to read
            something in a short amount of time (like a month).</p>
        <p>- But I will read faster if I know I can discuss the book afterwards. And I can achieve more successfully
            by either discussing the book on my Youtube channel, or a book club meeting. If you‚Äôre curious to know what
            I‚Äôm currently reading feel free to follow me on either <a href="#">goodreads</a> or
            my <a href="#">book instagram</a>.</p><br>

        <p>3. Blog posts</p>
        <p>- This whole ost is answering just that.</p>
        <p>- Actions for improvements are my steps moving forward</p><br>

        <p>4. Youtube Channel</p>
        <p>Since my Back from Hiatus post I actually managed to post 5 videos. But they weren‚Äôt
            great (<a href="#">see TV</a>). </p>
        <p>- 2 vlogs</p>
        <p>- 1 tech demo</p>
        <p>- 2 random clips</p><br>

        <p>I did learn that I tend to vlog more when I travel. And my tech demo, while good intentioned, needs a bit
            more explanation/audio.</p><br>

        <h2>What's new in general?</h2>
        <p>THIS is a loaded question. But I‚Äôll answer this based on this year, and I‚Äôll stick to bullet points though
            since that‚Äôs easier.</p><br>
        <p>Career </p>
        <p>- Work related ... Overall not much really. I‚Äôve gotten into a sort of rhythm at this point. Every project I
            get to work on with my team I always learn something new which is still fun. And depending on what
            repository I‚Äôve either forked or created will indicate what I‚Äôm focusing on. If your curious on what I‚Äôm
            working on now feel free to follow me on <a href="#">Github</a >.</p>
        <p>- Not work related ‚Äì I‚Äôve ‚Ä¶ been slacking‚Ä¶ hence this post.</p><br>

        <p>Personally</p>
        <p>- Mentally, in the realm of existence and meaning and the overwhelming fear of pandemic taking my life,
            I‚Äôve been heavily pondering if what I do in ANY capacity is making a difference on the planet and society.
            Not to sound grim, but the question of  ‚ÄúHow am I personally helping society, my race, my gender in all
            the actions I am taking?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I improving society to the best of my ability with the tools I have at my
            disposal?‚Äù</p>
        <p>- Obviously there is no quick solution and I can only answer it myself, but mentally, my headspace is there,
            and I have a direction in which I can answer that last question.</p><br>

        <h2>Am I still learning new things?</h2>
        <p>This is a yes‚Ä¶with a but though. As mentioned above, at work I always get to learn something new, and that
            is the biggest perk of my job! üòÄ But personally I‚Äôve been slacking. I made minor progress in improving my
            python, but nothing else that‚Äôs noteworthy. I don‚Äôt solely want to rely on my job to only learn new
            things. Learning new shit is something I know makes me legit happy, and that also plays a role in why I
            haven‚Äôt written a blog post in a long ass while.</p><br>

        <h2>Moving forward Action Items</h2>
        <p>While writing this post I found some action items I realize I can take moving forward.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blog once a month and detail what project(s) I‚Äôm excited to focus on, what book(s) I‚Äôve read throughout
                the month, and anything else I feel like sharing.</li>
            <li>Make an effort to attend some virtual conferences that are happening.</li>
            <li>Share thoughts on the books I read every quarter on Youtube channel.</li>
            <li>When I explore a new application/script/technology/etc, share visually what I learned, and record how
                to use it initially on my Youtube channel.</li>
            <li>Make an effort to contribute to open source projects that improve society in my spare time on the
                weekends. Projects focusing on climate changes, low waste living, helping local vegetable farmers,
                and anything animal/animal shelter and anything else I can think of that also aligns with my values.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>I will share my progress starting in May 31st, and every month after that.</p>
