    <h2>June Progress</h2>
    <h5>2020.07.09</h5>

        <br><br>
        June was not as productive for me. Iâ€™m embarrassed so Iâ€™ll keep it really short. I foresee a long list of
        improvements to take for the next month. Anyways lets see what I actually accomplished.<br><br>

        <strong>What books did I finish?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Sandworm by Andygreenberg</li>
            - 4 stars, would recommend <br>
            <li>Kingpin by Kevin Poulsen </li>
            - 3 stars, it was alright<br>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>What tech book am I focused on?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz </li>
            - On chapter 4 of 11<br>
            - its okay, but I think I might pick up another book Iâ€™m more excited for<br>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>What have I learned this month?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is where Iâ€™m embarrassed, I havenâ€™t learned much. The tech book Iâ€™m reading is not getting me excited all
        that much and Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s due to life in general being a little gray, or I just donâ€™t care for
        BHP right now.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>Did I participate in the tech community?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Sadly no, not this month</li>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>Did I publish a video on what I learned, vlog, etc?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Again, sadly no.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <strong>How can I improve for next month?</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading is progressing well, so no complaints ðŸ˜€ <3</li>
            <li>Tech book is not peaking my interest, but it might be that the more interesting chapters are further
                in the book, so if by Ch 6 Iâ€™m still not interested, then I might just put the book down and switch
                it up.</li>
            <li>July I am going to try and jump into machine learning. Just saying the words is putting a smile on my
                face. ðŸ™‚ But yeah, I will explore machine learning and see what I learn. <3</li>
            <li>July I am reading Countdown to Zero Day as part of the WeAreHackers/The Hacker Book Club and the book
                club meeting is on July 14, so I am MARKING MY CALENDAR to attend that! Iâ€™ve really been wanting to
                participate in the meetings and talking to fellow minded badass women/people. Hopefully the book turns
                out to be a 5 star book. ðŸ™‚</li>
            <li>July I might do a vlog on my quarantine life, maybe? Dunno, weâ€™ll seeâ€¦  /shrug</li>
        </ul><br>

        Thatâ€™s it for this blog post. If youâ€™re curious on what else Iâ€™m reading (cause I love reading usually) then
        feel free to follow me on goodreads! Also feel free to follow me on all the things.
