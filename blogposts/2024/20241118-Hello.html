        <br><br>
        It appears I haven't written anything all year and there's a reason for that that future me will know but
            is irrelevant to the world. This blog is mainly for future me to reflect upon. <br><br>

        This year was not what I expected.<br><br>

        November is a new chapter though. Late in the year, but that's life. My winter arc has now started.<br><br>

        Anyway, I am currently on the lookout for new job opportunities and realize it will be a challenge given
        the state of the country and the economy in general. I'm scared and worried about my future, and not
        just career wise. <br><br>

        Don't get me wrong. I am not unemployed. I have a job, it pays the bills, but it doesn't fill my soul with a sense
        of purpose or get me excited for the day. It's not a career. I clock in and clock out and I'm grateful I have it. But I
        feel as though I've just woken up from a nightware and have wasted this entire year and I'm just now trying to
        play catch up.<br><br>

        With that being said I think I'd like to document the process. I'm thinking maybe a vlog along with quarterly
        blog posts. I've already updated my resume and have applied to some places, but I'm embarrassed to say that
        I'm a bit rusty in my coding skills. They obviously don't go away, but the structure and habit is lacking.
        I need to build something asap, but build what? <br><br>

        And I'm also thinking I need to get a certificate. Maybe finally get my CompTIA Security+ certificate. Can't
        forget my security background.<br><br>

        Anyways, that's all for now. I'll see what I come up with. This year isn't over.
